# Titanic Data Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects of the passengers on the Titanic and predicted the survival rate of passengers.

## Overview

The Titanic Data Analysis project aims to uncover insights into the demographics and characteristics of passengers aboard the Titanic. The analysis covers aspects such as survival rates, passenger classes, gender distribution, and also predicted the survival rate of all passengers on board.

## Data Source

titanic data: the primary data used for this analysis and prediction is the "titanic.csv" file, containing details information on both survival and non-survival passengers

## Tools

* Python - For data cleaning, analysis and prediction
* Power BI - preparing dashboard for report

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The project is organized into Jupyter notebooks for a clear and reproducible analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA techniques were applied to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to create visualizations that enhance the interpretation of the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Basic statistical analyses were performed to derive meaningful insights.

## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following functios
1. Data loading and inspections
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

## EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA incolve exploring survival data to answer key questions:
1. What is the total surviving rate to death rate
2. what is the surviving rate to gender
3. Does Pclass affected the survival rate?
4. Does their geographical area affect the survivin rate

## VisualizationD

 Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to create visualizations that enhance the interpretation of the data.

I then included dashboard from Power BI, below is the dashboard created

## Predictions

I used Logi 
## Key Findings

- **Survival Rates**: Examined the overall survival rates and factors influencing survival.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of passengers based on age, gender, and passenger class.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to extract additional insights.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between different variables.
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: If applicable, you can include any machine learning models used for predictions.
